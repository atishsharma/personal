## 🚀 What This Is

This is the codebase that powers my personal blog. It's a **GitHub Pages** site — plain HTML with minimal JavaScript for PWA support. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

Content is entirely static, served from this repo’s **main** branch.

## 🛠 How to Work on This

You don’t need anything fancy — just a text editor and Git.


### Local Preview

Since this is static HTML, you can test locally with a simple server:

### Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000
Then open: http://localhost:8000

⚡ Want to Extend?

Future ideas (no sugar-coat):

Migrate to a proper static site generator (Jekyll / Hugo) for templating.

Add automated CI/CD for previews (GitHub Actions).

Improve PWA support (offline reading, caching strategy updates).

Add comments (e.g., Staticman or a lightweight solution).
